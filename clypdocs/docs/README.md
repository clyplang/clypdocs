# Clyp Documentation

This directory contains the markdown source used by Docusaurus to build
https://github.com/CodeSoftGit/clyp project's documentation site.

To run the docs locally:

```bash
cd clypdocs
npm install
npm run start
```

The site expects the `clyp` Python package to be available when running
examples or building API docs. Install the package with:

```bash
pip install -e ../clyp
```
