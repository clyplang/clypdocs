Clyp ships with a small standard library available through `clyp.std` and
`clyp.stdlib`. These modules provide convenience utilities commonly used
in scripts. The implementation is a thin layer over Python for
simplicity and familiar behavior.

This section documents each module and its functions with examples.

Submodules included:
- `fs` — file system helpers
- `json` — JSON helpers
- `math` — math utilities
- `random` — randomness utilities
- `time` — timing and sleep helpers

See the pages for details and examples.
