Contributing to Clyp Docs
=========================

Thanks for improving the docs!

Workflow
--------

1. Create or edit pages under `docs/` and add them to `sidebars.js`.
2. Run the local dev server (Docusaurus) to preview changes.
3. Open a PR with clear descriptions and link to code if relevant.

Style
-----

- Write clear examples that are copy-pastable.
- Keep API signatures in sync with the code.
- Use Markdown headings for structure and include `clyp` code fences when helpful.
